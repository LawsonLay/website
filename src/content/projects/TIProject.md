In the Spring 2025 semester, we created a minature smart city to simulate an application of Wi-SUN technology using Texas Instruments' LaunchPads, ti-web-app, ti-wfantund, the Kea DHCPv6 server, and a BeaglePlay. When run over by a RC car, the sensors would send a CoAP request to the central ti-web-app, to activate the corresponding light zones. All Router Nodes (sensors and lights) could be managed and monitored via our modified ti-web-app in real-time.

This project implements an adaptable and scalable DHCP service for Wi-SUN Field Area Networks (FAN), designed for smart city loT applications. Using BeaglePlayÂ® as a host device and Texas Instruments' LP-CC1352P7-1 evaluation boards as router nodes, we integrate a Kea DHCPv6 server and Stork dashboard to manage IPv6 address allocation.
