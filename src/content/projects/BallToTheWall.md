This is a game I made in my senior game design class. It uses Unity 6's DOTS and ECS to power a voxel based destruction game. By utilizing data-oriented design and the Burst compilation, Ball to the Wall achieves high performance on many devices without relying on any game development tricks or pre-baked meshes.

The main goal of the game is to break stuff with the ball. The more stuff you break, the bigger the ball gets. Once the ball is big enough, you can break the big bad place (the ant hill). There is one level, and there is no timer for this demo.
